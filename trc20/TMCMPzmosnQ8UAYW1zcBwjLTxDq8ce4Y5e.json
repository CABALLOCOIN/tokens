	"description": "PYRO is a TRC20 token designed with a hyper deflationary life model and staking functionalities. The core concept revolves around the in-built burning function of PYRO tokens upon any transaction that transfers PYRO from one TRON address to another at a rate of 5% while 2.5% of all burned PYRO proportionally rewarding those who have staked their tokens. A social network, privacy messenger and other projects will utilize PYRO.",
	"utility": "PYRO can be used by content creators and publishers. It can also be used for in-game dapp assets, or use as currency in gaming or to reward creators directly for their entertainment content or to purchase additional access. Staking/Freezing PYRO yields 2.5% rewards proportionate to the amount of PYRO a user stakes.",
